 Hello!
 
 You made it through the end. Thank you so much for your time and effort to look at this playground.
 I had a lot of fun creating this project and I hope that you enjoyed going through it.
 
 Because, if you went through the playground, you learned some things about me too.
 Sunny is very similar to me. I am a very positive person and I enjoy living life and helping others.
 
 I went through a really difficult time in the past and I did not know what to do.
 I felt alone and did not know that so many other people were dealing with the same issues.
 
 I had to learn to talk about my feelings, or in a more general way; **to express myself**. Either through sports,
 talking with loved ones, starting journaling and coding! Coding helped me a lot, it helped me visualize
 my thought processes and gave me valuable insights in how I think and the way I solve my problems. Thus becoming more conscious in life.

 My hope is that, by sharing my experiences through this playground,
 I can help or inspire others that are trying to deal with the same stuff.
 
 I hope that Sunny can be an inspiration to our beloved ones, friends, children and family
 and that they may even become more fearless than Sunny.
