#  "Sunny's Story" Playground Book 

## WWDC Scholarship Submission

This is my submission for an Apple WWDC 2019 Scholarship.

This Playground Book is about Sunny, a sun that has some personal issues. Through code we show it how it can be happy again!

In this repository you can find;
- The compiled **playgroundbook** file that can be put on an iPad running Swift playgrounds 2.0. (The enitre folder with extension .playgroundbook.)
- The full **project** in XCode, for when you want to get freaky with the code.

- The **video** of the playground on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Iqhe5GJcDtg).
